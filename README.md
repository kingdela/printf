This printf project is a collaboration between Kingsley Ohene and Jane Okeke. Who are Software Engineers studing at students of ALX school. This project involves a function named "_printf" which would imitate the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. This function contains some of the basic features and functions found in the man 3 of "printf".
